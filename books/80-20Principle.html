      <h1>The 80/20 Principle</h1>
      <summary>Written by Richard Koch</summary>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>We tend to expect that all causes will have roughly the same significance. That all customers are equally valuable. [p.10]</p>
      <p>We tend to assume to 50 percent of causes or inputs will account for 50 percent of results or outputs. There seems to be a natural expectation that causes and results are generally equally balanced, but this “50/50 fallacy” is one of our most inaccurate and yet deeply rooted mental maps. [p.10]</p>
      <p>Most of the time, we do not realize the extent to which some resources, but only a small minority, are super-productive — the vital few vs. the trivial many. [p.12]</p>
      <p>The universe is not a straight line – the 80/20 principle, like chaos theory, is based around the idea of non linearity. [p.14]</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>• A small initial influence can become greatly multiplied and produce highly unexpected results, which nevertheless can be explained in retrospect.[p.?]</p>
          <p>• A small lead early on can turn into a larger lead or a dominate position later on, until equilibrium is distributed and another small force then exerts a disproportionate influence.</P>
          <p>• At any point, a majority of any phenomenon will be explained or caused by a minority of the actors participating in the phenomenon) [p.?]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><mark>One of the messages of chaos theory is that equality ends in dominance. A 51/49 split is inherently unstable and tends to gravitate towards a 95/5, 99/1, or even 100/0 split.</mark> [p.17]</p>
      <p>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man - George Bernard Shaw [p.19]</p>
      <p>The few things that work fantastically well should be identified, cultivated, nurtured, and multiplied. [p.20]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>Typically, causes, inputs, or effort divide into two categories: one; the majority, that has little impact or two; a small minority, that has a major, dominant impact. [p.21]</p>
      <p>Nearly always, a small proportion of total products produces a large proportion of profits [p.24]</p>
      <p>Sometimes, 80 percent of the profits come from 30 percent of the products; sometimes it's from 15 percent or even 10 percent. The numbers compared do not have to add up 100, but the picture usually looks unbalanced. [p.24]</p>
      <p>Who you work for is more important than what you do [p.26]</p>
      <p>Long-term client relationships create trust and raise the cost to the client of switching to another consulting firm. Long-term clients tend to not be as price sensitive. [p.26]</p>
      <p>The 20 percent of the most important issues are not necessarily the most interesting ones. [p.?]</p>
      <p>Effort and reward are at best loosely linked. [p.27]</p>
      <p>Wealth from investment can dwarf wealth from working. [p.28]</p>
      <p>The conventional wisdom is not to put all your eggs in one basket. 80/20 wisdom is to choose a basket carefully, load all your eggs into it, and then watch it like a hawk. [p.28]</p>
      <p>Bar charts show the 80/20 relationship best. [p.33]</p>
      <p>The 80/20 analysis is generally used to change the relationship it describes, or to make better use of it (i.e. key causes, the inputs that lead to the outputs, etc). [p.34]</p>
      <p><mark>A firm that finds 80 percent of its profits come from 20 percent of its customers should use this information to concentrate on keeping that 20 percent happy and increasing the business carried out with them. This is much easier, as well as more rewarding than paying equal attention to the whole customer group.</mark> [p.35]</p>
      <p>80/20 analysis can also be misunderstood, misapplied, and instead of being the means to an unusual insight, serve as the justification for conventional thuggery. [p.36]</p>
      <p>The most valuable insight from 80/20 analysis will always come from examining nonlinear relationships that others are neglecting. [p.37]</p>
      <p>80/20 thinking starts with a hypothesis about a possible imbalance between inputs and outputs, but instead of collecting data and analyzing them, we estimate them. [p.38]</p>
      <p>Never assume that we automatically know what the answer is, instead ask: what are the vital few inputs or causes, as opposed to the trivial many. [p.38]</p>
      <p><mark>Calm down, work less and target a limited number of very valuable goals where the 80/20 principle will work for us, rather than pursuing every available opportunity.</mark> [p.39]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>Software (WordPerfect) First, they identify what customers want most of the time and how they want to do it—the old 80/20 rule (people use 20 percent of a program's functions 80 percent of the time). Good software developers make high-use functions as simple and automatic and inevitable as possible. [p.49]</p>
      <p><mark>It is only outside the business where there are results, opportunities, and threats.</mark> [p.50]</p>
      <p>The 80/20 Principle applied to business has one key theme – to generate the most money with the least expenditure of assets and effort. [p.51]</p>
      <p>A product has to be only 10 percent better value than that of a competing product to generate a sales difference of 50 percent and a profit difference of 100 percent. [p.54]</p>
      <p>Major alterations in a business system can flow from apparently insignificant causes. At any one time, people of equal intelligence, skill, and dedication can produce quite unequal results, as a result of a small structural differences. Events cannot be predicted, although predictable patterns tend to recur. [p.55]</p>
      <p>If you can identify where your firm is getting back more than it is putting in, you can up the stakes and make a killing. Similarly, if you can work out where your firm is getting back much less than it is investing, you can cut your losses. [p.56]</p>
      <p>The "where" can be anything. It can be a product, a market, a customer or type of customer, a technology, a channel or distribution, a department or division, a country, a type of transaction or an employee, type of employee or team. [p.56]</p>
      <p>What we are generally allowed to see in business if the net effect of what happens, which is by no means the whole picture. [p.57]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p><mark>It is almost inevitable that you are doing too many things for too many people.</mark> [p.58]</p>
      <p>Some customers pay high prices but have a high cost to serve: these are often smaller customers. The very big customers may be easy to deal with and take large volumes of the same product, but screw you down on price. Sometimes these differences balance out, but often they do not. [p.62]</p>
      <p>New clients who do not turn into long-serving clients were recognized as being lost makers, leading to a much more selective approach to pitching for businesses. [p.66]</p>
      <p>The best way to examine the profitability of your business is to break it down into competitive segments. [p.68]</p>
      <p>A competitive segment is a part of your business where you face a different competitor or different competitive Dynamics. [p.69]</p>
      <p>Do you face a different main competitor in this part of your business compared to the rest of it? [p.69]</p>
      <p>If you are up against a specialist competitor, your profitability will depend on the interaction of your product and service against theirs. Which do consumers prefer? And what is your total cost to deliver the product or service relative to your competitors? Your profitability will be as much determined by your competitors as by anything else. [p.69]</p>
      <p>Thinking about competitive segments lobs you straight at the most important way to split and think about your business. [p.70]</p>
      <p>Before reaching final decisions on any segment, however, the instrumentation group's top management examined the two other questions, besides probability, that are key to strategy: [p.75]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>• Is the segment and attractive market to be in?</p>
        <p>• How well is the firm position in each segment?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A "scale player" operates at a minimum size necessary to be profitable as soon as possible. [p.77]</p>
      <p>80/20 analysis of profits does not give us all the right answers. The analysis is bound to be a snapshot at a point in time and cannot (to start with) provide a picture of the trend or of forces that could change profitability. [p.78]</p>
      <p>The best way to start making money is to stop losing money. [p.78]</p>
      <p>For the full answer, you must look at segments market attractiveness and it how well the firm is positioned in each segment. [p.78]</p>
      <p>80 percent of the profits made in any industry are made by 20 percent of firms. If you aren’t one of these, what are they doing right that you're not? [p.80]</p>
      <p><mark>Where might less be better? [p.80]</mark></p>
      <p>Many consumers would buy a stripped-down, very cheap product. Is anyone providing it in your industry? [p.80]</p>
      <p>Most people prefer humans, but machines are more reliable and much cheaper. [p.81]</p>
      <p>The 80/20 Principle suggests that your strategy is wrong. If you make most of your money out of a small part of your activity, you should turn your company upside down and concentrate your efforts on multiplying this small part. [p.82]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p>Nearly everything we make is much more complex than it needs to be. Our clothing, our food, our household furnishings—all could be much simpler than they now are and at the same time be better-looking. [p.83]</p>
      <p>Few people stop to ask why the unprofitable business is so bad. Even fewer stop to think whether you could in practice, as well as in theory, have a business solely composed of the most profitable chunks and get rid of 80 percent of the overhead.[p.84]</p>
      <p><mark>Simple is beautiful. Business people seem to love complexity.</mark> [p.85]</p>
      <p>The act of making a business more complex depresses returns more effectively than any other means known to humanity. [p.85]</p>
      <p>The problem is not extra scale, but extra complexity. Additional scale, without additional complexity, will always give lower unit costs. [p.87]</p>
      <p>When new business is different from existing business, even if it is only slightly different, costs tend to go up. [p.87]</p>
      <p>Small is beautiful. All other things being equal, big is beautiful. But all other things are not equal. [p.88]</p>
      <p>Only one characteristic differentiated the winners from the less successful firms: simplicity. [p.89]</p>
      <p>Parts of the business that are mature and simple can be amazingly profitable. Cutting the number of products, customers, and suppliers usually leads to higher profits, partly because you can have the luxury of just focusing on the most profitable activities and customers, but partly also because the costs of complexity. [p.89]</p>
      <p>The best approach is to decide is the part of the value-adding chain (R&D/manufacturing/distribution/selling/marketing/servicing) where your company has the greatest comparative advantage—and then ruthlessly outsource everything else. [p.90]</p>
      <p>The key problem with head offices is not their cost; it is the way they take away real responsibility and initiative from those who do the work and add the value to customers. [p.90]</p>
      <p>Corporations can center themselves around customer needs rather than around the management. [p.90]</p>
      <p>Executives are often staggered to learn that the most neglected areas are the most profitable. It is no accident. (And one of the unfortunate products of 80/20 Analysis is sometimes that the most profitable areas get a lot more attention from managers at the top. As a result, they can begin to drop down the profitability league table). [p.90]</p>
      <p>For customers, the quest for self-importance is at least as important as the quest for value. [p.90]</p>
      <p>Simplicity raises prices as well lowering costs. [p.90]</p>
      <p>If you focus on the most profitable segments, you can grow them surprisingly fast—nearly always at 20 percent a year sometimes even faster. [p.91]</p>
      <p>Often the most profitable, is to harvest these segments [less profitable], deliberately losing market share. You let go of the less profitable customers and products, cut off most support and sales effort, raise prices, and allow sales to decline at 5-20 percent while you laugh all the way to the bank. [p.91]</p>
      <p>What is most simple and standardized is hugely more productive and cost-effective than what is complex. [p.91]</p>
      <p><mark>The simplest messages are the most appealing and universal.</mark> [p.91]</p>
      <p>Letting the customer access your business system—as with all forms of self-service-creates choice, economy, speed, and spend. [p.92]</p>
      <p>Make the simplest 20 percent as high quality and consistent as imaginable. [p.92]</p>
      <p>The 50/5 Principle asserts that, typically, 50 percent of a company’s customers, products, components, and suppliers will add less than 5 percent to revenues and profits. Getting rid of the low-volume (and negative value) 50 percent of items is the key to reducing complexity. [p.93]</p>
      <p>The road to hell is paved with the pursuit of volume. Volume leads to marginal products, marginal customers, and greatly increased managerial complexity. [p.93]</p>
      <p>All organizations, especially large and complex ones, are inherently inefficient and wasteful. They do not focus on what they should be doing. They should be adding value to their customers and potential customers. Any activity that does not fulfill this goal is unproductive. [p.94]</p>
      <p>Waste thrives on complexity; effectiveness requires simplicity. [p.95]</p>
      <p>All effective techniques to reduce costs use three 80/20 insights: simplification, through elimination of unprofitable activity; focus, on a few key drivers of improvements; and comparison of performance. The last two deserve elaboration. [p.95-96]</p>
      <p>Be selective. Do not tackle everything with equal effort. Cost reduction is an expensive business! [p.96]</p>
      <p>Remember above all that equal cost does not lead to equal customer satisfaction. [p.96]</p>
      <p>Sometimes it is more useful to draw an 80/20 Chart on the basis of the financial impact of the problem (or opportunity) rather than the number of causes. [p.98]</p>
      <p>The 80/20 Principle states that there always are a few high-productivity areas and many low-productivity ones. [p.98]</p>
      <p>Great leaps forward require measurement and comparison of the value delivered to customers and what they will pay for it. [p.99]</p>
      <p><mark>The way to create something great is to create something simple.</mark> [p.99]</p>
      <p>Anyone who is serious about delivering better value to customers can easily do so, by reducing complexity. [p.99]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>It is absolutely right to be marketing led and customer centered. But it can also (be dangerous). If the product range is extended into too many new areas, or if the obsession with customers leads to recruiting more and more marginal customers, unit costs will rise and returns fall. [p.103]</p>
      <p>The vast majority of firms’ costs lie outside the factory. These costs can be penal if the product range is too large. [p.103]</p>
      <p><mark>You will only be successful in marketing if what you are marketing is different and, for your target customers, either unobtainable elsewhere, or provided by you in a product/service/price package that is much better value than is obtainable elsewhere.</mark> [p.104]</p>
      <p>You can not innovate without a new product or service [p.104]</p>
      <p>Note that there are always apparently good reasons trotted out as to why you need the unprofitable 80 percent of products, in this case the fear of “losing stature” by having a smaller product line. Excuses like this rest on the strange view that shoppers like to see a lot of products they have no intention of buying. [p.104-105]</p>
      <p>In 99 percent of cases is that delisting marginal products boosts profits while not harming customer perceptions one iota. [p.105]</p>
      <p><mark>He told them to pull up their socks and mange their point-of-sales displays properly. This didn’t work. Instead he should have concentrated on the best 20 percent of car washes. What are they doing right? Could they do more of it? What did they have in common? [p.105]</mark></p>
      <p>Focus on the few best products is much less important than focusing on the few best customers. [p.105]</p>
      <p>Keep in closest contact with the 20 percent of your clients who give you 80 percent of your business. [p.106] </p>
      <p>The core customer group that matters: those that consume heavily and frequently. [p.106]</p>
