      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>What he discovered, as chronicled in his book War, was that the courage needed to engage in battle was indistinguishable from love. Because of the strong brotherhood the soldiers had formed, they were more concerned about what happened to their buddies than about what happened to themselves. [4]</p>
      <p>It takes a number of critical factors to win an NBA championship, including the right mix of talent, creativity, intelligence, toughness, and, of course, luck. But if a team doesn't have the most essential ingredient— love-none of those other factors matter. [4]</p>

        <p>I discovered that the more I tried to exert power directly, the less powerful I became. [12]</p>
        <p>Foster an environment in which everyone plays a leadership role, from the most unschooled rookie to the veteran superstar. If your primary objective is to bring the team into a state of harmony and oneness, it doesn't make sense for you to rigidly impose your authority. [13]</p>
        <p>The Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki likened the mind to a cow in a pasture. If you enclose the cow in a small yard, it will become nervous and frustrated and start eating the neighbor's grass. But if you give it a large pasture to roam around in, it will be more content and less likely to break loose. [18]</p>
        <p><mark>You can't be a coach if you need to be liked. [22]</mark></p>
        <p>Focusing on something other than the business at hand can be the most effective way to solve complex problems. When the mind is allowed to relax, inspiration often follows. [22]</p>
        <p><mark>Obsessing about winning is a loser's game: The most we can hope for is to create the best possible conditions for success, then let go of the outcome. [23]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p>On the road, there were no curfews or bed checks. Red had only one rule: The hotel bar belonged to him. He didn't care where you went or what you did as long as you didn't interrupt his late-night scotch with trainer Danny Whelan and the beat writers. Although he was more accessible than other coaches, he felt it was important to maintain a certain distance from the players because he knew that someday he might have to cut or trade one of us.

        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p>I felt confident enough to throw my whole mind, body, and soul into what I loved —and that, as much as anything, has been the secret of my success in sports. [44]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
        <p>Each person is an island unto himself, in a very real sense, and he can only build bridges to other islands if he is first of all willing to be himself and permitted to be himself. [92]</p>
        <p>What I discovered playing for the Knicks is that when I got too excited mentally, it had a negative effect on my ability to stay focused under pressure. [99]</p>
        <p>At its heart, mindfulness is about being present in the moment as much as possible, not weighed down by thoughts of the past or the future. [99]</p>
        <p><mark>My brother Joe often talks about faith being one of the two things that can help you cope with fear. The other is love. Joe says you need to have faith that you've done all you could to make sure things turn out right—regardless of the final outcome. [102]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        <p>In The Tao of Leadership, John Heider stresses the importance of interfering as little as possible. "Rules reduce freedom and responsibility," he writes. "Enforcement of rules is coercive and manipulative, which diminishes spontaneity and absorbs group energy. The more coercive you are, the more resistant the group will become.” [121]</p>
        <p>Maslow believed that the highest human need is to achieve "self-actualization," which he defined as "the full use and exploitation of one's talents, capacities and potentialities. [123]</p>
        <p><mark>The task of life is to keep your world in order. And that takes discipline, a healthy balance between work and play and nourishment of mind, body, and spirit. [125]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
        <p>It’s all about being present and taking responsibility for how you relate to yourself and others. [156]</p>
        <p>Sturdy spokes poorly placed make a weak wheel. [161]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
        <p><mark>"Everything changes." Those words, Suzuki said, contain the basic truth of existence: Everything is always in flux. Until you accept this, you won't be able to find true equanimity. But to do that means accepting life as it is, not just what you consider the "good parts." "That things change is the reason why you suffer in this world and become discouraged.” [168]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
        <p><mark>Looking back, I think my struggle with Jerry taught me things about myself that I couldn't have learned any other way. The Dalai Lama calls it "the enemy's gift." From a Buddhist perspective, battling with enemies can help you develop greater compassion for and tolerance of others. "In order to practice sincerely and to develop patience," he says, "you need someone who willfully hurts you. Thus, these people give us real opportunities to practice these things. They are testing our inner strength in a way that even our guru cannot." [185]</mark></p>
        <p><mark>“We think that the point is to pass the test or to overcome the problem, but the truth is that things don't really get solved. They come together again and fall apart again. It's just like that. The healing comes from letting there be room for all of this to happen: room for grief, for relief, for misery, for joy." [200-201]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
        <p>To achieve greatness, you must rely on the good offices of others. [216]</p>
        <p><mark>A team leader's number one job, I explained, was to build up his teammates. [218]</mark></p>
        <p>"You can't be captain if nobody follows you." [219]</p>
        <p>The Buddha taught that life is suffering and that the primary cause of our suffering is our desire for things to be different from the way they actually are. [219]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
        <p>“With enthusiasm you find you don't have to do it all yourself. In fact, there is nothing of significance you can do by yourself.” - Eckhart Tolle [244]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
        <p>"To be trusted is a greater compliment than to be loved.” - George Macdonald [249]</p>
        <p><mark>I always welcomed debate, even if it disrupted team harmony temporarily, because it showed that the players were engaged in solving the problems. [251]</mark></p>
        <p>The mistake that championship teams often make is to try to repeat their winning formula. But that rarely works because by the time the next season starts, your opponents have studied all the videos and figured out how to counter every move you made. The key to sustained success is to keep growing as a team. Winning is about moving into the unknown and creating something new. [251]</p>
        <p><mark>I realized there wasn't much I could do to change his behavior. But what I could do was change the way I reacted to his angry outbursts. [251]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
        <p>In some Native American tribes, the elders used to identify the angriest braves in the village and teach them to transform their wild, uncontrolled energy into a source of creative power and strength. Those braves often became the most effective tribal leaders. That’s what I've tried to do with the young players on my teams. [268]</p>
        <p>My practice when anger arises is to sit with it in meditation. I simply observe it come and go, come and go. Slowly, incrementally, over time I've learned that if I can stay with the anger, which often manifests itself as anxiety, and resist my conditioned response to suppress it, the intensity of the feeling dissipates and I'm able to hear the wisdom it has to impart. [269]</p>
        <p>Kobe had interpreted my efforts to give him a wide berth as indifference. So I decided to take another tack and work much more actively with him. [272]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
        <p>The coaches goal was to set down some basic guidelines for us on how to play basketball together as a group. And then you were expected to create your own chart for everything else. It was an uncanny way of creating organization without over-organizing. It wasn't about what they thought you should be doing, the way many coaches do. They stepped back and let you find your own way. [293-294]</p>
        <p>I tried to convey to him that the best way to get off the emotional roller coaster is to take the middle way and not get too high when you win or too low when your game fails you. [302-303]</p>
        <p><mark>To get there, Kobe had to learn to give in order to get back in return. Leadership is not about forcing your will on others. It’s about mastering the art of letting go. [309]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
        <p>"It’s not just a basketball way of leadership," he says, "but a philosophy of how to live. Being present and enjoying each moment as it comes. Letting my children develop at their own pace and not trying to force them into doing something they're not really comfortable with, but just nurturing and guiding them along, learned that all from Phil!" I'm grateful for the thought. [316-317]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
        <p><mark>“We are all failures—at least the best of us.” J. M. Barrie [322]</mark></p>
        <p>Although telling the truth is never a mistake, there can be serious repercussions. And timing matters. [327]</p>
        <p><mark>As a rule, players usually have an easier time dealing with loss than coaches. They can go in and take a shower, then come out and say, "I'm tired and hungry. Let's go get something to eat." But coaches don't have the same kind of release that comes from playing a grueling physical game. Our nervous systems tend to keep firing long after the arena has cleared. [333]</mark></p>
        <p>Coaching takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride that's hard to stop, even when you've diligently practiced letting go of your desire for things to be different than they actually are. There always seems to be just a bit more to let go of. [333]</p>
        <p>If I've learned anything in my years of practicing Zen and coaching basketball, it's that what we resist persists. Sometimes the letting go happens quickly; other times it may take several sleepless nights. Or weeks. [333]</p>
        <p>As a leader your job is to do everything in your power to create the perfect conditions for success by benching your ego and inspiring your team to play the game the right way. [334]</p>

        <h2>Afterward</h2>
        <p>As Steinbeck put it, "A journey is like marriage. The certain way to be wrong is to think you control it. [335]</p>
        <p>She told a story about a monk in the Middle Ages who traveled to a nearby city to visit a famous ascetic who turned out to be a merchant living in a busy market district. That night, while they were praying, the monk was rattled by the noise some drunks and prostitutes were making in the street and asked the merchant "How on earth can you stand this every night?" The merchant replied, "I just say to myself, They're all going to the kingdom." [346]</p>
