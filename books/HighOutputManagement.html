      <h1>High Output Management</h1>
      <summary>Written by Andrew S. Grove</summary>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Under this strong attack, we learned that we must lead with our strength. Being second best in a tough environment is just not good enough. [x]</p>
      <p>If the world operates as one big market, every employee will compete with every person anywhere in the world who is capable of doing the same job. [xi]</p>
      <p>As a manager in such a workplace, you need to develop a higher tolerance for disorder. [xiv]</p>
      <p>We found that all our employees "produce" in some sense— some make chips, others prepare bills, while still others create software designs or advertising copy. [xvi]</p>
      <p>You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event. [xvii]</p>
      <p>As a general rule, you have to accept that no matter where you work, you are not an employee-you are in a business with one employee: yourself. You are in competition with millions of similar businesses. [xviii]</p>
      <p>You must continually dedicate yourself to retaining your individual competitive advantage. [xix]</p>
      <p>Nobody owes you a career. You own it as a sole proprietor. You must compete with millions of individuals every day, and every day you must enhance your value, hone your competitive advantage, learn, adapt, get out of the way, move from job to job, even from industry to industry if you must and retrench if you need to do so in order to start again. [xix]</p>
      <p>Are you plugged into what's happening around you? And that includes what's happening inside your company as well as inside your industry as a whole. Or do you wait for a supervisor or others to interpret whatever is happening? [xx]</p>
      <p><mark>The key to survival is to learn to add more value [xx]</mark></p>

        <p>Manager's output = the output of his organization + the output of the neighboring organizations under his influence. [xxiii]</p>
        <p><mark>That's what being a manager is about. It's not about how smart you are or how well you know your business; it's about how that translates to the team's performance and output. [xxiv]</mark></p>
        <p>When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can't do it or won't do it; he is either not capable or not motivated. [xxiv]</p>
        <p><mark>If you only understand one thing about building products, you must understand that energy put in early in the process pays off tenfold and energy put in at the end of the program pays off negative tenfold. [xxiv]</mark></p>
        <p>If you are not training, then you are basically neglecting half the job. [xxiv]</p>
        <p>It's funny that you say that about management books. I recently ran out of space on my bookshelf at home, so I was faced with a choice. I either had to throw away some books or buy a bigger house. Well, that was an easy decision, but which books to throw out? Then I thought, the management books! But I had a problem. Nearly every management book that I'd received was sent to me by the author and was autographed with a kind inscription. I felt badly about throwing away all those nice notes. So, I went through each book and tore out the inscription page then threw away the book. So now I have a large stack of pages of nice notes to me and plenty of space for good books. [xvii]</p>

        <p>The task here encompasses the basic requirements of production. These are to build and deliver products in response to the demands of the customer at a scheduled delivery time, at an acceptable quality level, and at the lowest possible cost. [3]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p>Indicators tend to direct your attention toward what they are monitoring. It is like riding a bicycle: you will probably steer it where you are looking. If, for example, you start measuring your inventory levels carefully, you are likely to take action to drive your inventory levels down, which is good up to a point. But your inventories could become so lean that you can't react to changes in demand without creating shortages. So because indicators direct one's activities, you should guard against overreacting. This you can do by pairing indicators, so that together both effect and counter-effect are measured. [17]</p>
        <p>A measurement-any measurement—is better than none. But a genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. [17]</p>
        <p>The black box sorts out what the inputs, the output, and the labor are in the production process. We can improve our ability to run that process by cutting some windows in our box so that we can see some of what goes on within it. [20]</p>
        <p>I have found the "stagger chart" the best means of getting a feel for future business trends. [23]</p>
        <p>The improvement or deterioration of the forecasted outlook from one month to the next provides the most valuable indicator of business trends that I have ever seen. I would go as far as to say that it's too bad that all economists and investment advisers aren't obliged to display their forecasts in a stagger chart form. [24]</p>
        <p>We should deliberately build a reasonable amount of "slack" into the system. And inventory is the most obvious place for it. Clearly, the more inventory we have, the more change we can cope with and still satisfy orders. But inventory costs money to build and keep, and therefore should be controlled carefully. Ideally, inventory should be kept at the lowest-value stage. [27]</p>
        <p>To get acceptable quality at the lowest cost, it is vitally important to reject defective material at a stage where its accumulated value is at the lowest possible level. Thus, as noted, we are better off catching a bad raw egg than a cooked one, and screening out our college applicant before he visits Intel. In short, reject before investing further value. [28]</p>
        <p>The lowest-value-point inspection where we inspect raw material is called incoming material inspection or receiving inspection! If we again use a black box to represent our production process, inspections that occur at intervening points within it are called logically enough, in-process inspections. Finally, the last possible point of inspection, when the product is ready to be shipped to the customer, is called final inspection or outgoing quality inspection. [28-29]</p>
        <p><mark>The key principle is to reject the defective "material" at its lowest-value stage. [29]</mark></p>
        <p>A very important way to increase productivity is to arrange the work flow inside our black box so that it will be characterized by high output per activity, which is to say high-leverage activities. [35]</p>
        <p><mark>No matter what reason may be given for a step, you must critically question each and throw out those that common sense says you can do without. [36]</mark></p>
        <p><mark>Stressing output is the key to improving productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite. [36]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p>The output of a manager is a result achieved by a group either under her supervision or under her influence. While the manager's own work is clearly very important, that in itself does not create output. Her organization does. [41]</p>
        <p><mark>A manager must form opinions and make judgments, he must provide direction, he must allocate resources, he must detect mistakes, and so on. All these are necessary to achieve output. [41]</mark></p>
        <p>What we actually do is difficult to pin down and sum up. Much of it often seems so inconsequential that our position in the business hardly seems justified. Part of the problem here stems from the distinction between our activities, which is what we actually do, and our output, which is what we achieve. [42]</p>
        <p>My day always ends when I'm tired and ready to go home, not when I'm done. A manager's work is never done. There is always more to be done, more that should be done, always more than can be done. [47]</p>
        <p>A manager must keep many balls in the air at the same time and shift his energy and attention to activities that will most increase the output of his organization. In other words, he should move to the point where his leverage will be the greatest. [47]</p>
        <p>There is an especially efficient way to get information, much neglected by most managers. That is to visit a particular place in the company and observe what's going on there. [49]</p>
        <p>Beyond relaying facts, a manager must also communicate his objectives, priorities, and preferences as they bear on the way certain tasks are approached. This is extremely important, because only if the manager imparts these will his subordinates know how to make decisions themselves that will be acceptable to the manager, their supervisor. [50]</p>
        <p>Your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager's life. [51]</p>
        <p>A great deal of a manager's work has to do with allocating resources: manpower, money, and capital. But the single most important resource that we allocate from one day to the next is our own time. [53]</p>
        <p>Before you are horrified by how much time I spend in meetings, answer a question: which of the activities-information-gathering, information-giving, decision-making, nudging, and being a role model—could I have performed outside a meeting? The answer is practically none. [53]</p>
        <p>You must choose the most effective medium for what you want to accomplish, and that is the one that gives you the greatest leverage. [53]</p>
        <p>After going through the annual planning process, an Intel manager saw that, in spite of successful cost reduction efforts in the prior year, his division was still not going to make any money in the coming year. The manager became depressed. Though he didn't realize it, he almost immediately began to affect people around him and soon depression spread throughout his organization. He snapped out of it only when someone on his staff finally told him what he was doing to the people under him. Another example is waffling, when a manager puts off a decision that will affect the work of other people. In effect, the lack of a decision is the same as a negative decision; no green light is a red light, and work can stop for a whole organization. [57]</p>
        <p>Managerial meddling is also an example of negative leverage. This occurs when a supervisor uses his superior knowledge and experience of a subordinate's responsibilities to assume command of a situation rather than letting the subordinate work things through himself. [57]</p>
        <p>The art of management lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them. [58-59]</p>
        <p><mark>Picture this. I am your supervisor, and I walk over to you with pencil in hand and tell you to take it. You reach for the pencil, but I won't let go. So I say, "What is wrong with you? Why can't I delegate the pencil to you?" We all have some things that we don't really want to delegate simply because we like doing them and would rather not let go. [59]</mark></p>
        <p>Avoid the charade of insincere delegation, which can produce immense negative managerial leverage. [60]</p>
        <p>Delegation without follow-through is abdication. You can never wash your hands of a task. Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment, and monitoring the delegated task is the only practical way for you to ensure a result. Monitoring is not meddling, but means checking to make sure an activity is proceeding in line with expectations. Because it is easier to monitor something with which you are familiar, if you have a choice you should delegate those activities you know best. But recall the pencil experiment and understand before the fact that this will very likely go against your emotional grain. [60]</p>
        <p>Monitoring the results of delegation resembles the monitoring used in quality assurance. We should apply quality assurance principles and monitor at the lowest-added-value stage of the process. For example, review rough drafts of reports that you have delegated; don't wait? [60]</p>
        <p>To use quality assurance principles effectively, the manager should only go into details randomly, just enough to try to ensure that the subordinate is moving ahead satisfactorily. To check into all the details of a delegated task would be like quality assurance testing 100 percent of what manufacturers turned out. [61]</p>
        <p>If we determine what is immovable and manipulate the more yielding activities around it, we can work more efficiently. [62]</p>
        <p>Forecasting and planning your time around key events are literally like running an efficient factory. [63]</p>
        <p><mark>It is important to say "no" earlier rather than later because we've learned that to wait until something reaches a higher value stage and then abort due to lack of capacity means losing more money and time." [64]</mark></p>
        <p>Inventory should consist of things you need to do but don't need to finish right away— discretionary projects, the kind the manager can work on to increase his group's productivity over the long term. [65]</p>
        <p>A manager should allocate about a half day per week to each of his subordinates. (Two days a week per subordinate would probably lead to meddling; an hour a week does not provide enough opportunity for monitoring.) [66]</p>
        <p><mark>Strive toward regularity. [67]</mark></p>
        <p>Let's apply a production concept. Manufacturers turn out standard products. By analogy, if you can pin down what kind of interruptions you're getting, you can prepare standard responses for those that pop up most often. [69]</p>
        <p><mark>Customers don't come up with totally new questions and problems day in and day out, and because the same ones tend to surface repeatedly, a manager can reduce time spent handling interruptions using standard responses. Having them available also means that a manager can delegate much of the job to less experienced personnel. [69]</mark></p>
        <p>To make something regular that was once irregular is a fundamental production principle, and that's how you should try to handle the interruptions that plague you. [70]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p>How much experience does a given subordinate have with the specific task at hand? This is not the same as the experience he has in general or how old he is. [74]</p>
        <p>Even when a problem isn't tangible, even if it's only an intuition that something's wrong, a subordinate owes it to his supervisor to tell him, because it triggers a look into the organizational black box. [75]</p>
        <p>A real time-saver is using a "hold" file where both the supervisor and subordinate accumulate important but not altogether urgent issues for discussion at the next meeting. [76]</p>
        <p><mark>Peer interaction-especially decision-making by a group of peers-is not easy. Yet it is key to good management. [79]</mark></p>
        <p>What should be discussed at a staff meeting? Anything that affects more than two of the people present. If the meeting degenerates into a conversation between two people working on a problem affecting only them, the supervisor should break it off and move on to something else that will include more of the staff, while suggesting that the two continue their exchange later. [80]</p>
        <p><mark>What is the role of the supervisor in the staff meeting—a leader, observer, expediter, questioner, decision-maker? The answer, of course, is all of them. Please note that lecturer is not listed. A supervisor should never use staff meetings to pontificate, which is the surest way to undermine free discussion and hence the meeting's basic purpose. [80]</mark></p>
        <p>The chairman must have a clear understanding of the meeting's objective—what needs to happen and what decision has to be made. The absolute truth is that if you don't know what you want, you won't get it. So before calling a meeting, ask yourself: What am I trying to accomplish? Then ask, is a meeting necessary? Or desirable? Or justifiable? Don't call a meeting if all the answers aren't yes. [84]</p>
        <p>Determine the purpose of a meeting before committing your time and your company's resources. [85]</p>
        <p>Decision-making is not a spectator sport, because onlookers get in the way of what needs to be done. [85]</p>
      </section>

        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p>Usually when a meeting gets heated, participants hang back, trying to sense the direction of things, saying nothing until they see what view is likely to prevail. They then throw their support behind that view to avoid being associated with a losing position. [90]</p>
        <p>In our business we have to mix knowledge-power people with position-power people daily, and together they make decisions that could affect us for years to come. If we don't link our engineers with our managers in such a way as to get good decisions, we can't succeed in our industry. [93]</p>
        <p>When knowledge and position power are separated, the sense of uncertainty can become especially acute, because the knowledge people are often not comfortable with the purely business-related factors that might influence a decision. What is often heard is, "We don't know what the company [or division or department] wants of us." Similarly, managers holding position power don't know what to do because they realize they don't know enough about the technical details to arrive at the correct decision. [96]</p>
        <p>Sometimes free discussion goes on in an unending search for consensus. But, if that happens, people can drift away from the near consensus when they are close to being right, diminish. ing the chances of reaching the correct decision. So moving on to make the decision at the right time is crucial. [97]</p>
        <p>One of the manager's key tasks is to settle six important questions in advance. What decision needs to be made? When does it have to be made? Who will decide? Who will need to be consulted prior to making the decision? Who will ratify or veto the decision? Who will need to be informed of the decision? [97-98]</p>
        <p>The sensitivities of two interest groups coming to bear on a single decision is quite common in real corporate life. In such meetings, it is important to give to the two sides roughly equal representation, because only from such balance will an even-handed decision emerge. [99]</p>
        <p><mark>If good decision-making appears complicated, that's because it is and has been for a long time. [101]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p>How one plans at the factory can then be summarized as follows: step 1, determine the market demand for product; step 2, establish what the factory will produce if no adjustment is made; and step 3, reconcile the projected factory output with the projected market demand by adjusting the production schedule. [103]</p>
        <p><mark>What do my customers want from me now? Am I satisfying them? What will they expect from me one year from now? You need to focus on the difference between what your environment demands from you now and what you expect it to demand from you a year from now. [104]</mark></p>
        <p>While it is impossible to be precise in every case, it is prudent to factor in some percentage of loss for managerial projects as well. [105]</p>
        <p><mark>Much confusion exists between what is strategy and what is tactics. Although the distinction is rarely of practical significance, here's one that might be useful. As you formulate in words what you plan to do, the most abstract and general summary of those actions meaningful to you is your strategy. What you'll do to implement the strategy is your tactics. [105-106]</mark></p>
        <p><mark>To avoid such a fate, remember that as you plan you must answer the question: What do I have to do today to solve-or better, avoid-tomorrow's problem? [109]</mark></p>
        <p>Be careful not to plan too frequently, allowing ourselves time to judge the impact of the decisions we made and to determine whether our decisions were on the right track or not. In other words, we need the feedback that will be indispensable to our planning the next time around. [109]</p>
        <p>"If you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there." A successful MBO system needs only to answer two questions: 1. Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the : objective.) 2. How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results.) [110-111]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
        <p>Management is not just a team game, it is a game in which we have to fashion a team of teams, where the various individual teams exist in some suitable and mutually supportive relationship with each other. [120]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
        <p>The business of any business is to respond to the demands and needs of its environment. [126]</p>
        <p>The most important task before such an organization is the optimum and timely allocation of its resources and the efficient resolution of conflicts arising over that allocation. [129]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
        <p>Our behavior in a work environment can be controlled by three invisible and pervasive means. These are: free-market forces, contractual obligations, cultural values [145]</p>
        <p>Words like trust-because you are surrendering to the group your ability to protect yourself. And for this to happen, you must believe that you all share a common set of values, a common set of objectives, and a common set of methods. [147]</p>
        <p>In a contractual obligation, management has a role in setting and modifying the rules, monitoring adherence to them, and evaluating and improving performance! As for cultural values, management has to develop and nurture the common set of values, objectives, and methods essential for the existence of trust. [148]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
        <p>No matter how well a team is put together, no matter how well it is directed, the team will perform only as well as the individuals on it [157]</p>
        <p><mark>The single most important task of a manager is to elicit peak performance from his subordinates. [158]</mark></p>
        <p>There's the story of a young Intel manager, Chuck, when he was a first-year student at the Harvard Business School. Initially, he was engulfed by a fear of the class material, of his professors, of failure, of flunking out. After a while his fear gave way to the realization that everyone else was in the same boat, also afraid. Students began to form study groups whose ostensible purpose was to consider class material together, but whose real purpose was to strengthen confidence. [162]</p>
        <p>Output will tend to be greater when everybody strives for a level of achievement beyond his immediate grasp, even though trying means failure half the time. Such goal-setting is extremely important if what you want is peak performance from yourself and your subordinates. [165]</p>
        <p><mark>The Ph.D. in computer science who knows an answer in the abstract, yet does not apply it to create some tangible output, gets little recognition, but a junior engineer who produces results is highly valued and esteemed. [166]</mark></p>
        <p>If the absolute sum of a raise in salary an individual receives is important to him, he is working mostly within the physiological or safety modes. If, however, what matters to him is how his raise stacks up against what other people got, he is motivated by esteem/recognition or self-actualization, because in this case money is clearly a measure. [167]</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
        <p>The inevitable conclusion is that high output is associated with particular combinations of certain managers and certain groups of workers. This also suggests that a given managerial approach is not equally effective under all conditions. [173]</p>
        <p>The conclusion is that varying management styles are needed as task-relevant maturity varies. Specifically, when the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective style moves from the structured to one more given to communication, emotional support, and encouragement, in which the manager pays more attention to the subordinate as an individual than to the task at hand. As the TRM becomes even greater, the effective management style changes again. Here the manager's involvement should be kept to a minimum, and should primarily consist of making sure that the objectives toward which the subordinate is working are mutually agreed upon. [174]</p>
        <p>An associate of mine who had always done an outstanding job hired a junior person to handle some old tasks, while he himself took on some new ones. The subordinate did poor work. My associate's reaction: "He has to make his own mistakes. That's how he learns!" The problem with this is that the subordinate's tuition is paid by his customers. [177]</p>
        <p><mark>We managers must learn to fight such prejudices and regard any management mode not as either good or bad but rather as effective or not effective, given the TRM of our subordinates within a specific working environment. [178]</mark></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
        <p>There is one that is more important than any of the others: it is to improve the subordinate's performance. [182-183]</p>
        <p>Our society values avoiding confrontation. Even the word "argument" is frowned upon, something I learned many years ago when I first came to this country from Hungary. In Hungarian, the word "argument" is frequently used to describe a difference of opinion. [183]</p>
        <p>The biggest problem with most reviews is that we don't usually define what it is we want from our subordinates, and, as noted earlier, if we don't know what we want, we are surely not going to get it. [184]</p>
        <p>Think back to our concept of the managerial "black box." Using it, we can characterize performance by output measures and internal measures. The first represent the output of the black box, and include such things as completing designs, meeting sales quotas, or increasing the yield in a production process-things we can and should plot on charts. The internal measures take into account activities that go on inside the black box: whatever is being done to create output for the period under review and also that which sets the stage for the output of future periods. [184-185]</p>
        <p><mark> At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential. [187]</mark></p>
        <p>Performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the one we would accord to his organization! [187]</p>
        <p>When we promote our best, we are saying to our subordinates that performance is what counts. [188]</p>
        <p><mark>With 20/20 hindsight, we can compare what the subordinate did against what he might have done, and the variance can tell both of us how to do things better in the future. [188]</mark></p>
        <p>There are three L's to keep in mind when delivering a review: Level, listen, and leave yourself out. [188]</p>
        <p>If his responses—verbal and nonverbal—do not completely assure you that what you've said has gotten through, it is your responsibility to keep at it until you are satisfied that you have been heard and understood. [189]</p>
        <p>A poor performer has a strong tendency to ignore his problem. Here a manager needs facts and examples so that he can demonstrate its reality. Progress of some sort is made when the subordinate actively denies the existence of a problem rather than ignoring it passively, as before. [193]</p>
        <p>If the supervisor wants to go on to find the solution when the subordinate is still denying or blaming others, nothing can happen. [195]</p>
        <p>We are after a person's performance, not our psychological comfort. [195]</p>
        <p>Under no circumstances should you pretend that you and your subordinates are equal during performance reviews. [198]</p>

        <p>Why do you think you are ready for this new role? What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you? [205]</p>
        <p>The ultimate purpose of interviewing is to make a judgment about how the candidate would perform in your company's environment. [206]</p>
        <p>When you're hiring, you must judge potential contribution. [206]</p>
        <p>In almost all such cases, the employee is quitting because he feels he is not important to you. If you do not deal with the situation right at the first mention, you'll confirm his feelings and the outcome is inevitable. [210]</p>
        <p>Don't argue, don't lecture, and don't panic. Remember, this is only the opening skirmish, not the war. And you cannot win the war here-but you can lose it! [210]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 15</h2>
        <p>If the absolute amount of a raise in salary is important, that person is probably motivated by physiological or safety/security needs. If the relative amount of a raise-what he got compared to others—is the important issue, that person is likely to be motivated by self-actualization, because money here is a measure, not a necessity. [213]</p>
        <p>There are times when a person is promoted into a position so much over his head that he performs in a below-average fashion for too long a time. The solution is to recycle him: to put him back into the job he did well before he was promoted. Unfortunately, this is a very difficult thing to do in our society. People tend to view it as a personal failure. In fact, management was at fault for misjudging the employee's readiness for more responsibility. Usually the person who was promoted beyond his capability is forced to leave the company rather than encouraged to take a step back. This is often rationalized by the notion that "It is better that we let him go, for his own sake." I think it is dead wrong to force someone in such circumstances out of the company. Instead, I think management ought to face up to its own error in judgment and take forthright and deliberate steps to place the person into a job he can do. Management should also support the employee in the face of the embarrassment that he is likely to feel. If recycling is done openly, all will be pleasantly surprised how short-lived that embarrassment will be. And the result will be a person doing work we know from past experience he can perform well. In my experience, such people, once they regain their confidence, will be excellent candidates for another promotion at a later time-and the second time they are likely to succeed. [220]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
        <p>Training should be a process, not an event. [224]</p>
        <p>Training is hard work. Preparing lectures and getting yourself ready to handle all the questions thrown at you is difficult. Even if you have been doing your job for a long time and even if you have done your subordinates' jobs in great detail before, you'll be amazed at how much you don't know. Don't be discouraged—this is typical. Much deeper knowledge of a task is required to teach that task than simply to do it. [227]</p>
