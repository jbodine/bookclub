      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>He enjoyed the night shift the most because it afforded him a greater window of silence, allowing him more time for reading or for praying [15]</p>
      <p>This experience of manual labor led him to remark many years later, "I was a laborer for 4 years, and for me those 4 years of work are worth more than two doctorate degrees!" [16]</p>
      <p>At many moments in its history, Poland existed only as a culture and an idea, while its political identity was being repressed and overrun by various tyrants. [19]</p>
      <p><mark>Just as an arrow is readied for the shot from the bow, God prepares the proper people, He prepares his arrows... [22]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p>By the end of the Nazi occupation, one third of the Polish clergy had been murdered. More than three thousand were imprisoned in concentration camps, and because nearly half of them were interned at Dachau, it became the largest monastery in the world. [25]</p>
        <p>As the Nazis stormed through his house, Karol hid in the basement praying. He heard the footsteps of the soldiers pass the door of the basement, but they never opened it. Many years later, as pope, he reminisced, "Sometimes I would ask myself: so many young people of my own age are losing their lives, why not me? Today I know that it was not mere chance. Amid the overwhelming evil of the war, everything in my own personal life was tending towards the good of my vocation." [27]</p>
        <p>As some Poles said, "The Germans will take our body, and the Soviets will take our soul." [30]</p>
        <p>By evening, you could hardly drag your legs, but you have to go on, because you know that people wait for you, that they wait all year long for this meeting. [32]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p>So I set off, first in the canoe over the waves of the river, and then in a truck laden with sacks of flour, until I got to Olsztynek. The train for Warsaw left late at night. I had brought my sleeping bag with me, thinking that I might be able to catch a few winks in the station and ask someone to wake me when it was time to board the train. There was no need for that in any event, because I didn't sleep. Upon arriving, he questioned the bishop's decision because of his age, asking, "Your Eminence, I am too young: I'm only thirty-eight." Wyszynski responded, "That is a weakness which can soon be remedied. Please do not oppose the will of the Holy Father." Without any further hesitation, Wotyta asked, "Where do I sign?" Before returning to his friends in the woods, he first needed to take a night train to Kraków, to give his archbishop the news of his assignment. Because the train was not scheduled to depart for several hours, he made a visit to a nearby chapel. Father Jan Zieja recalls that evening in 1958, when Wotyta knocked on the door of the convent, looking to spend some time in prayer. A nun led him to the chapel and he was left alone. Zieja recalls: When he did not emerge for some time, they looked in on him. He lay prostrate on the ground. The sister stepped back, filled with respect... After another while, the sister looked into the chapel again. The priest still lay prostrate. But the hour was late. The sister went up to him and shyly asked, "Perhaps Father would be so kind to come to supper?”–The stranger responded: My train to Kraków isn't until after mid-night. Allow me to stay here. I have much to discuss with the Lord. Eight hours after his prayer began, he departed at 11:30 to catch his train. [39-40]</p>
        <p>"The more deeply people develop within themselves in their interior life, the more prone they are to silence... Every great work, all holiness, is born in silence and recollection... Only falsehood wraps itself in a flood of words. Truth is brief." [42]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p>He knew the gates of hell would not prevail against the Church, while the communist empire had been built upon sand. [48]</p>
        <p>Because he had only three weeks to prepare for the monumental responsibility of preaching to Paul VI and the Papal Household (and translating the twenty-two sermons into Italian), he moved temporarily into a convent to prepare without distractions. The Cardinal woke up each day, early as usual, and wrote until noon. He'd then go skiing for the afternoon and resume writing in the evening. When asked on one occasion if it was unbecoming for a cardinal to ski, he answered, "It is unbecoming for a cardinal to ski badly." [49]</p>
        <p>He had always been a simple man. Coworkers at the Solvay chemical plant recalled that he would sometimes arrive at work without his coat or sweater because he met someone while walking to work who needed it more than he did. On one occasion, he arrived shaking from the frigid walk, after having given his coat to an elderly man who was slightly intoxicated and close to freezing. As a parish priest in Poland, someone gave him the gift of a pillow and quilt. He passed it on to a poor woman who had been the victim of a robbery, and returned to his habit of sleeping on his bare bed. Nuns at his church noticed he wasn't dressed warmly enough for the bitter Polish winter, so they knitted him a thick woolen sweater. Within a week, it was gone, because he had given it to the poor. On one occasion, he was late for Mass because he needed the sacristan to loan him shoes for the service because he gave his own away! [50]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p><mark>What God commands, which may seem humanly impossible, he gives us the means to carry out. That is the secret to every vocation. Every vocation changes our plans, disclosing a new one, and it is astonishing to see how much inner help God gives us. [59]</mark></p>

        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p>Of the estimated forty million martyrs in the history of Christianity, perhaps twenty-seven million of them were murdered in the twentieth century. Therefore, more Christians died for their faith in the last century than in all previous centuries combined. [72]</p>
        <p><mark>The person who is working is always more important than the work the person is doing. [78]</mark></p>
        <p>The more holy a person becomes, the more human he becomes. As he told the college students in Kraków, "every man who seeks the Kingdom of God finds himself." [80]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
        <p>Permissiveness does not make men happy. The consumer society does not make men happy. It never has. [84]</p>
        <p>The students recalled that he wouldn't lecture them, but instead listened intently and then led them by asking questions that brought them closer to the answer. [86]</p>
        <p>Young people didn't make the trips to see him because he was simply a good man, but because he was capable of revealing to them their own capacity for goodness. He saw something in the youth that perhaps they didn't even see in themselves. [94]</p>
        <p><mark>What claims to be a shortcut to happiness leads nowhere. [95]</mark></p>
        <p>Many priests try to be like the kids. We were trying to be like him. [95]</p>
        <p>Young people often sense an unnerving level of disintegration within themselves because their beliefs and behaviors aren't often in harmony. [95]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
        <p>We must never forget that only when love between human beings is put to the test can its true value be seen. [105]</p>
        <p><mark>Love is not something that is given to couples or something that "happens" to them. Rather, it is a task, thrown to them by God. The measure of their love is not the intensity of their emotions or attractions, but rather the degree to which they feel responsible for one another. [106]</mark></p>
        <p>When God created mankind, he declared it to be "very good," yet it was "not good" for man to be alone. The reason for this is that Adam and Eve are made in the image and likeness of God, and God does not exist in solitude. [114]</p>
        <p>The cause of poverty is not the poor. It's war, inhumane political systems, lack of education, and an unjust distribution of resources. [122]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        <p>Someone who no longer belonged to this world, but was living those minutes in complete communion with God, with the saints, and with all the souls of heaven. The unreal sparkle of the snow all around emphasized this impression. A complete silence had descended. Everything was motionless, as if a state of contemplation had taken hold of every element of nature... [131]</p>
        <p>For no matter how numerous our activities, our ministries, however numerous our concerns, our exertions—if there is no love, everything becomes meaningless. [136]</p>
        <p>"In the absence of a deep inner life, a priest will imperceptibly turn into an office clerk, and his apostolate will turn into a parish office routine, just solving daily problems." [137]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
        <p>As soon as I regained consciousness after the attack in St. Peter's Square, my thoughts turned to this shrine and I wanted to express here my gratitude to our Heavenly Mother for having saved my life. ... there are no mere coincidences in the designs of Divine Providence. [146]</p>
        <p>John Paul was disinterested in the details of the investigations into who may have plotted his demise. He said, "It doesn't interest me; because it was the devil who did this thing. And the devil can conspire in a thousand ways, none of which interest me." [155]</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, John Paul had a strong devotion to his guardian angel-although it is fair to speculate that he probably had a legion of them! He said, "My Guardian Angel knows what I am doing. My faith in him, in his protective presence, continues to grow deeper and deeper." Before deplaning in Turkey, a reporter asked him if he felt he was in danger. John Paul answered, "Love is stronger than danger." [159]</p>
        <p>It seemed that he was talking to the Virgin Mary. The prelate replied, "We know. He does that all the time, and she's the only one he listens to around here." [164]</p>
        <p>Praying a Hail Mary is comparable to giving the Virgin Mary a rose. Praying an entire Rosary with love and devotion is like giving her an entire bouquet. However, Marian consecration is giving her one's own self. [166-167]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
        <p>"Physical condition or advancing of age are not obstacles to a perfect life. God does not look at external things but at the soul!" [181] </p>
        <p>One of the fruits of human suffering is that it awakens love in others. It reminds people to make a gift of themselves? [181]</p>
        <p>When John Paul met those who were suffering, he knew he was encountering Christ in a unique way. Therefore he did everything in his power to express God's mercy to them. As Father Michael Gaitley remarked, "Mercy is love when it meets suffering." [185]</p>
        <p>Despite the miraculous work that God performed through the Pope's prayers for physical healings, the Holy Father knew that all such healings are temporary. Even Lazarus had to die again. What was more important to John Paul was that God might use him as an instrument of his Divine Mercy, bringing healing to souls. [188]</p>
        <p>While walking a few blocks from the Vatican, a monsignor from the Archdiocese of New York recognized a beggar on the steps of a church. The two had been in the seminary together, but the poor man admitted he had "crashed and burned" in his vocation and left the priesthood. The priest managed to arrange for the poor man to meet with the Pope. When the two were alone, instead of probing for details about the poor man's fall from the priesthood, the Holy Father clasped his hands and asked him to hear his confession. The man objected, "I'm a beggar," to which John Paul replied, "So am I." With that, the fallen-away priest heard the Pope's confession and absolved him of his sins. The priest then dropped to his knees and asked the Holy Father to absolve him as well. After the confessions, John Paul remarked, "Do you see the grandeur of the priesthood? Don't besmirch it." The Pope then assigned the priest to a nearby parish, to minister to the homeless. [190]</p>
        <p>With each ailment, he sought God's plan behind it. He said, "I ask myself what God is trying to tell me with this disease”. [192]</p>
        <p>A person is as old as his soul, not his arteries! [197]</p>
        <p><mark>Two and a half months before his death, a Spanish bishop visited him and said that this would probably be the last time they would see each other. John Paul wisecracked, "Why, what's the matter? Are you sick?" [197]</mark></p>
        <p>"Just when night engulfs us, we must think about dawn coming, we must believe that every morning the Church is revived through her saints." Each one of them has been raised to the altars not because they have conquered the world, but because they allowed Christ to conquer them. Every saint is a unique "victory of God in man." [204-205]</p>
