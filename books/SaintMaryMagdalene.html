      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>Scripture is by nature a mystery that demands humble and prayerful meditation. [25]</p>
      <p>Feuillet begins his commentary by lamenting the fact that certain contemporary scholars use biblical criticism to create more problems than they solve. Alas, he says, we often use it to demolish rather than to construct. [26]</p>
      <p>When Mary the sister of Lazarus anointed the feet of Jesus with costly ointment in Bethany, Jesus said something very unusual when Judas asked why the ointment was not sold and the money given to the poor: "Let her keep it for the day of my burial" (Jn 12:7). Our Lord often says things in a manner that is at first incomprehensible so that his listeners will meditate on his words more deeply. [41]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p>She quickly became the subject of conversation in the town, for she was as beautiful as she was wealthy and such a combination often attracts the worst company. [47]</p>
        <p>At that time, Greek literature and philosophy, as well as the pagan practices of Roman culture, were held in great admiration by many worldly Jews who were growing tired of their own people's religiosity and much more pious way of life. [48]</p>
        <p>The Jews with a Greek education always seemed so much more cultivated than those of Judaea and so their example began to influence their brothers in the Holy Land. [48]</p>
        <p>After several years in this dark world of the rich and famous, however, she was left with nothing but a bitter heart and a troubled conscience. [49]</p>
        <p>Deeply disturbed by all of the brutality she had witnessed. Nobody's life is safe where power and glory are prized so highly. [49]</p>
        <p>She knew that the God he represented was good. She had always felt that the Creator was a harsh judge, to whom she could not dare to draw close, but now she truly understood the words of the Psalm that she had heard so often in her youth but that had always left her baffled: "The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in mercy" (Ps 145:8). [57]</p>
        <p>Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little (7:47) [59]</p>
        <p>Why did they reject the baptism of John? It was a baptism of repentance, and in order to receive it they needed to acknowledge their own sinfulness and to plunge themselves into the Jordan waters alongside the tax collectors and the other public sinners. Because they could not humble themselves to acknowledge their own need of God's mercy, they now find themselves in opposition to the Saviour. [59-60]</p>
        <p><mark>A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. When they could not pay, he forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more? Simon answered, "The one, I suppose, to whom he forgave more." And he said to him, "You have judged rightly." [60]</mark></p>
        <p><mark>It is no longer the self-righteous person who prides himself on following the Law to the letter who can think that he is just before the Lord, but rather the one who knows he is a poor sinner in need of God's mercy. This attitude alone makes us capable of receiving grace. To believe that one has already reached holiness without the help of Christ is not only an illusion but a dangerous spiritual sickness that can prove to be eternally fatal. [61]</mark></p>
        <p>Once sinners experience the liberation from their debt of guilt, gratitude for the divine mercy will enkindle in their hearts a fire of love that far surpasses the lukewarm ritualism of one who has never authentically experienced his need to be forgiven. [62]</p>
        <p>The story of Magdalene is a source of hope for the broken. [62]</p>
        <p>The Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene, who were standing side by side at the foot of the Cross: the first was perfect innocence and the second was perfect penitence. [62]</p>
        <p><mark>Jesus teaches the world that it is not physical contact with a sinful person that makes one unclean before God but rather the pride and the wickedness that come from the heart. [64]</mark></p>
        <p>When the Day of Judgement reveals the truth about human hearts. "The tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God" (Mt 21:31) more easily than those who might appear as righteous to the world and themselves. [65]</p>
        <p>The sacred humanity of Christ is the very fountain of grace and purity for all of the great saints, who because of his impeccable holiness were empowered to live lives free from the blemish of grave sin. [65]</p>
        <p>The love of lifelong faithful souls is often more calm and subdued, but the love of converts is a devouring flame that consumes their hearts and spills over into the most zealous acts of devotion. [69]</p>
        <p>Important for us all to be aware that we receive grace from Jesus in proportion to our interior receptivity. [70]</p>
        <p>He lived like the birds in the sky, counting on his heavenly Father to inspire generous souls to provide for his needs. Mary felt called to be one of those souls. [75]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p><mark>The women Magdalene had known in the court of Herod were also beautiful, among the most physically beautiful to be found, and yet in their desire to appear beautiful, so as to be admired by others, they actually lost something of their true beauty. They wanted to be like goddesses, put upon a pedestal to be adored. As soon as another more beautiful woman appeared, they would resent and despise her in their hearts. Magdalene could see now that vanity actually spoiled true beauty and caused nothing but spitefulness and jealousy. [77]</mark></p>
        <p>Those who have learned to contemplate and to adore Jesus Christ thirst no more for the vanities of the world (Jn 6:35) [80]</p>
        <p>To whom much is given, of him will much be required (Lk 12:48) [83]</p>
        <p>He seemed to love poor sinners in a special way but had no tolerance for sin whatsoever. [83-84]</p>
        <p>Luke is writing during the lifetime of this persecuted family, but John, who writes much later, is not subject to the same degree of caution and thus he reveals a little more. [89]</p>
        <p>Life is difficult and it brings all kinds of trials, the reasons for which we will know only in heaven and which are not always the consequences of our sins. Good and innocent people often have many mysterious sufferings to bear. [91]</p>
        <p>Sometimes, however, we question the Lord's concern for us even when our problems stem from our own way of thinking and acting. [91-92]</p>
        <p><mark>Overly active people do not reason in a spiritual way, and they are often tempted to judge the value of a person's actions based on their apparent utility or productivity. [93]</mark></p>
        <p>Martha misses this communication from the Lord because she is too distracted, and often this is true for us. We fail to perceive Christ's presence and to receive his inspirations because we are distracted by many things. [96-97]</p>
        <p>In studying the lives of the saints we see that it was very often during their time of thanksgiving after Mass that they experienced mystical ecstasies and received insights that changed the world. [99]</p>
        <p><mark>The word for "anxious" describes excessive worry about material things, a disposition that smothers the spiritual life. The word literally means that she thinks too much about many things unworthy of using up the energies of her mind, while the mind of Mary is fixed upon the one thing necessary. To worry is to think too much about what causes fear, usually some apprehension about the future. [102-103]</mark></p>
        <p>We should do what we can to provide for the material needs of our loved ones and then trust in the providence of God to take care of the rest. Anxiety about all of this can express a lack of trust in God. [103]</p>
        <p>Jesus makes visible the invisible mystery of God's mercy. In him, it is as though the pure, inaccessible light that is the essence of God passes through a prism and we can behold all the colours of the divine mystery. [104]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p>They knew that, if accepted, the implications of his message would completely transform the status quo and revolutionise the faith and worship of all of Israel. In spite of his signs and wonders, this was a prospect too disturbing to consider, especially for those who profited the most from the business of religion. Their attachment to long-held positions of power and the benefits that went with them was stronger than their openness to the will of God. [111]</p>
        <p><mark>Those who are set in their ways and attached to their privileges refuse to listen to any message that might bring an unsettling change. [111]</mark></p>
        <p>A surface reading of biblical texts is never enough to grasp divine truths, and often it is a surface reading of things that has led to the rejection of the identification theory. [113]</p>
        <p>Only when our lives are over do we fully understand the goodness of God and the spiritual value of our trials. [115]</p>
        <p>Jesus demands heroic trust from his friends, and this means that he demands a trust that remains intact even when the appearance of things tempts us to think that our trust is in vain. Saints continue to trust, even in the most apparently impossible situations, and it is such trust that is demanded of Martha and Mary. [116]</p>
        <p>Trying to make sense of the mystery of death, they would have been tempted by the usual falsehoods that almost always well up in a grief-stricken soul. First, they would have tried to! Find some way of blaming themselves for what had happened, then other people, and then perhaps the physician who could have done more to help their brother. Then they would have been tempted to think that perhaps poor Lazarus himself had done something to merit his premature end. Above all they would have been tempted by that most dangerous of all temptations, the one which the accuser will invariably try to whisper into the aching human heart at some point or another, namely, the temptation to doubt the love of the Lord. [119]</p>
        <p>Jesus himself was the new Temple, the place of God's Real Presence on earth. [125]</p>
        <p>Wherever there is a spiritual Lazarus raised from the dead, very often there is a weeping Magdalene who has brought it about. [129]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <p>As he sees her before him, Jesus knows that this beautiful soul is capable of understanding far more than so many others because she has learned the secret of love. She has learned from his Mother the sacred art of silently pondering the mystery of love that is Jesus Christ. [134]</p>
        <p>Too many distractions and worldly desires make our love for God evaporate, and as the life of Magdalene teaches us, it is only through the holy silence of contemplation of Christ that the perfume of love remains intact. [136]</p>
        <p>She was first the woman who sat in silence at his feet listening to his Word. [136]</p>
        <p>Saints are characterized by the desire to please God in all of their actions. Some people never get far along the road to holiness because they are too attached to their reputations and afraid of what others will think if they do anything seemingly radical out of love for God. [136]</p>
        <p>Saint Thomas Aquinas said that Christ's head symbolises his divinity and his feet symbolise his humanity; when we adore both we accomplish today a mystical anointing of the Lord. [141]</p>
        <p>The truth in the heart of Judas was that he opposed the ways of Christ. The spiritual and mysterious ways of Jesus bitterly disappointed him; Jesus of Nazareth failed to fulfill Judas' expectations of the Messiah. He wanted a strong man who would win over the crowds to his cause and lead them to retake Jerusalem from the Romans and gloriously restore the dynasty of David. [143]</p>
        <p><mark>We spend all of our time labouring for what will perish and not for that which endures forever ( Jn 6:27) [148]</mark></p>
        <p>Nothing that we give to the Lord is ever wasted, for he rewards every sacrifice with a hundredfold generosity. [150]</p>
        <p>"She has done what she could" (Mk 14:8). This is the judgement of Christ upon the actions of Mary Magdalene. How lovely it would be if the just Judge were to one day say the same of us too. [151]</p>
        <p>Saint Faustina came to the realization that it is not the apparent greatness of our works that really counts but rather the love with which we carry them out. [151]</p>

        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p>The light shines brighter when it is surrounded by darkness. [156]</p>
        <p>How many Catholics arise from bended knee and approach the altar of Holy Communion with "amen" on their lips but unbelief in their hearts? [166]</p>
        <p><mark>This poor broken sinner who had been transformed into an angelic adorer of the heart of Christ was not called to do anything on Calvary except love. [174]</mark></p>
        <p>Holiness is to a large extent a matter of purifying the intention of our hearts. What do you seek from Jesus? [187]</p>

        <p>He would come to them in his risen glory in his own time but he wanted the way to be prepared first by an angel of love. [197]</p>
